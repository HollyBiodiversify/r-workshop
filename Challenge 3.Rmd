First let me create a little example that I have a question about. I want to know how I change the color of the geom_points in my ggplot.Â 

```{r REPREX}
library(reprex)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point()
```

Then I go to my Console and type: reprex()
